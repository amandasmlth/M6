0,0,A free bird leaps
1,0,on the back of the wind   
2,0,and floats downstream   
3,0,till the current ends
4,0,and dips his wing
5,0,in the orange sun rays
6,0,and dares to claim the sky
7,0,
8,0,But a bird that stalks
9,0,down his narrow cage
10,0,can seldom see through
11,0,his bars of rage
12,0,his wings are clipped and   
13,0,his feet are tied
14,0,so he opens his throat to sing
15,0,
16,0,The caged bird sings   
17,0,with a fearful trill   
18,0,of things unknown   
19,0,but longed for still   
20,0,and his tune is heard   
21,0,on the distant hill   
22,0,for the caged bird   
23,0,sings of freedom
24,0,
25,0,The free bird thinks of another breeze
26,0,and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
27,0,and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn
28,0,and he names the sky his own
29,0,
30,0,But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams   
31,0,his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream   
32,0,his wings are clipped and his feet are tied   
33,0,so he opens his throat to sing
34,0,
35,0,The caged bird sings   
36,0,with a fearful trill   
37,0,of things unknown   
38,0,but longed for still   
39,0,and his tune is heard   
40,0,on the distant hill   
41,0,for the caged bird   
42,0,sings of freedom
43,1,We unaccustomed to courage
44,1,exiles from delight
45,1,live coiled in shells of loneliness
46,1,until love leaves its high holy temple
47,1,and comes into our sight
48,1,to liberate us into life
49,1,
50,1,Love arrives
51,1,and in its train come ecstasies
52,1,old memories of pleasure
53,1,ancient histories of pain
54,1,Yet if we are bold
55,1,love strikes away the chains of fear
56,1,from our souls
57,1,
58,1,We are weaned from our timidity
59,1,In the flush of loves light
60,1,we dare be brave
61,1,And suddenly we see
62,1,that love costs all we are
63,1,and will ever be
64,1,Yet it is only love
65,1,which sets us free
66,2,There is no warning rattle at the door   
67,2,nor heavy feet to stomp the foyer boards   
68,2,Safe in the dark prison I know that   
69,2,light slides over
70,2,the fingered work of a toothless   
71,2,woman in Pakistan
72,2,Happy prints of
73,2,an invisible time are illumined   
74,2,My mouth agape
75,2,rejects the solid air and
76,2,lungs hold The invader takes   
77,2,direction and
78,2,seeps through the plaster walls   
79,2,It is at my chamber entering   
80,2,the keyhole pushing
81,2,through the padding of the door   
82,2,I cannot scream A bone
83,2,of fear clogs my throat
84,2,It is upon me It is
85,2,sunrise with Hope
86,2,its arrogant rider
87,2,My mind formerly quiescent
88,2,in its snug encasement is strained
89,2,to look upon their rapturous visages   
90,2,to let them enter even into me   
91,2,I am forced
92,2,outside myself to
93,2,mount the light and ride joined with Hope
94,2,
95,2,Through all the bright hours   
96,2,I cling to expectation until   
97,2,darkness comes to reclaim me
98,2,as its own Hope fades day is gone   
99,2,into its irredeemable place
100,2,and I am thrown back into the familiar   
101,2,bonds of disconsolation
102,2,Gloom crawls around
103,2,lapping lasciviously
104,2,between my toes at my ankles   
105,2,and it sucks the strands of my   
106,2,hair It forgives my heady   
107,2,fling with Hope I am
108,2,joined again into its
109,2,greedy arms
110,3,Beloved
111,3,In what other lives or lands
112,3,Have I known your lips
113,3,Your Hands
114,3,Your Laughter brave
115,3,Irreverent
116,3,Those sweet excesses that
117,3,I do adore
118,3,What surety is there
119,3,That we will meet again
120,3,On other worlds some
121,3,Future time undated
122,3,I defy my bodys haste
123,3,Without the promise
124,3,Of one more sweet encounter
125,3,I will not deign to die
126,4,Your hands easy
127,4,weight teasing the bees
128,4,hived in my hair your smile at the
129,4,slope of my cheek On the
130,4,occasion you press
131,4,above me glowing spouting
132,4,readiness mystery rapes
133,4,my reason
134,4,
135,4,When you have withdrawn
136,4,your self and the magic when
137,4,only the smell of your
138,4,love lingers between
139,4,my breasts then only
140,4,then can I greedily consume
141,4,your presence
142,5,Petulant priests greedy
143,5,centurions and one million
144,5,incensed gestures stand
145,5,between your love and me
146,5,
147,5,Your agape sacrifice
148,5,is reduced to colored glass
149,5,vapid penance and the
150,5,tedium of ritual
151,5,
152,5,Your footprints yet
153,5,mark the crest of
154,5,billowing seas but
155,5,your joy
156,5,fades upon the tablets
157,5,of ordained prophets
158,5,
159,5,Visit us again Savior
160,5,Your children burdened with
161,5,disbelief blinded by a patina
162,5,of wisdom
163,5,carom down this vale of
164,5,fear We cry for you
165,5,although we have lost
166,5,your name
167,6,Pretty women wonder where my secret lies
168,6,I’m not cute or built to suit a fashion model’s size   
169,6,But when I start to tell them
170,6,They think I’m telling lies
171,6,I say
172,6,It’s in the reach of my arms
173,6,The span of my hips   
174,6,The stride of my step   
175,6,The curl of my lips   
176,6,I’m a woman
177,6,Phenomenally
178,6,Phenomenal woman   
179,6,That’s me
180,6,
181,6,I walk into a room
182,6,Just as cool as you please   
183,6,And to a man
184,6,The fellows stand or
185,6,Fall down on their knees   
186,6,Then they swarm around me
187,6,A hive of honey bees   
188,6,I say
189,6,It’s the fire in my eyes   
190,6,And the flash of my teeth   
191,6,The swing in my waist   
192,6,And the joy in my feet   
193,6,I’m a woman
194,6,Phenomenally
195,6,
196,6,Phenomenal woman
197,6,That’s me
198,6,
199,6,Men themselves have wondered   
200,6,What they see in me
201,6,They try so much
202,6,But they can’t touch
203,6,My inner mystery
204,6,When I try to show them   
205,6,They say they still can’t see   
206,6,I say
207,6,It’s in the arch of my back   
208,6,The sun of my smile
209,6,The ride of my breasts
210,6,The grace of my style
211,6,I’m a woman
212,6,Phenomenally
213,6,Phenomenal woman
214,6,That’s me
215,6,
216,6,Now you understand
217,6,Just why my head’s not bowed   
218,6,I don’t shout or jump about
219,6,Or have to talk real loud   
220,6,When you see me passing
221,6,It ought to make you proud
222,6,I say
223,6,It’s in the click of my heels   
224,6,The bend of my hair   
225,6,the palm of my hand   
226,6,The need for my care   
227,6,’Cause I’m a woman
228,6,Phenomenally
229,6,Phenomenal woman
230,6,That’s me
231,7,You may write me down in history
232,7,With your bitter twisted lies
233,7,You may trod me in the very dirt
234,7,But still like dust Ill rise
235,7,
236,7,Does my sassiness upset you
237,7,Why are you beset with gloom
238,7,’Cause I walk like Ive got oil wells
239,7,Pumping in my living room
240,7,
241,7,Just like moons and like suns
242,7,With the certainty of tides
243,7,Just like hopes springing high
244,7,Still Ill rise
245,7,
246,7,Did you want to see me broken
247,7,Bowed head and lowered eyes
248,7,Shoulders falling down like teardrops
249,7,Weakened by my soulful cries
250,7,
251,7,Does my haughtiness offend you
252,7,Dont you take it awful hard
253,7,’Cause I laugh like Ive got gold mines
254,7,Diggin’ in my own backyard
255,7,
256,7,You may shoot me with your words
257,7,You may cut me with your eyes
258,7,You may kill me with your hatefulness
259,7,But still like air I’ll rise
260,7,
261,7,Does my sexiness upset you
262,7,Does it come as a surprise
263,7,That I dance like Ive got diamonds
264,7,At the meeting of my thighs
265,7,
266,7,Out of the huts of history’s shame
267,7,I rise
268,7,Up from a past that’s rooted in pain
269,7,I rise
270,7,Im a black ocean leaping and wide
271,7,Welling and swelling I bear in the tide
272,7,
273,7,Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
274,7,I rise
275,7,Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear
276,7,I rise
277,7,Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave
278,7,I am the dream and the hope of the slave
279,7,I rise
280,7,I rise
281,7,I rise
282,8,Some clichty folks
283,8,dont know the facts
284,8,posin and preenin
285,8,and puttin on acts
286,8,stretchin their backs
287,8,
288,8,They move into condos
289,8,up over the ranks
290,8,pawn their souls
291,8,to the local banks
292,8,Buying big cars
293,8,they cant afford
294,8,ridin around town
295,8,actin bored
296,8,
297,8,If they want to learn how to live life right
298,8,they ought to study me on Saturday night
299,8,
300,8,My job at the plant
301,8,aint the biggest bet
302,8,but I pay my bills
303,8,and stay out of debt
304,8,I get my hair done
305,8,for my own selfs sake
306,8,so I dont have to pick
307,8,and I dont have to rake
308,8,
309,8,Take the church money out
310,8,and head cross town
311,8,to my friend girls house
312,8,where we plan our round
313,8,We meet our men and go to a joint
314,8,where the music is blue
315,8,and to the point
316,8,
317,8,Folks write about me
318,8,They just cant see
319,8,how I work all week
320,8,at the factory
321,8,Then get spruced up
322,8,and laugh and dance
323,8,And turn away from worry
324,8,with sassy glance
325,8,
326,8,They accuse me of livin
327,8,from day to day
328,8,but who are they kiddin
329,8,So are they
330,8,
331,8,My life aint heaven
332,8,but it sure aint hell
333,8,Im not on top
334,8,but I call it swell
335,8,if Im able to work
336,8,and get paid right
337,8,and have the luck to be Black
338,8,on a Saturday night
339,9,Give me your hand
340,9,
341,9,Make room for me
342,9,to lead and follow
343,9,you
344,9,beyond this rage of poetry
345,9,
346,9,Let others have
347,9,the privacy of
348,9,touching words
349,9,and love of loss
350,9,of love
351,9,
352,9,For me
353,9,Give me your hand
354,10,Your skin like dawn
355,10,Mine like musk
356,10,
357,10,One paints the beginning
358,10,of a certain end
359,10,
360,10,The other the end of a
361,10,sure beginning
362,11,I note the obvious differences
363,11,in the human family
364,11,Some of us are serious
365,11,some thrive on comedy
366,11,
367,11,Some declare their lives are lived
368,11,as true profundity
369,11,and others claim they really live
370,11,the real reality
371,11,
372,11,The variety of our skin tones
373,11,can confuse bemuse delight
374,11,brown and pink and beige and purple
375,11,tan and blue and white
376,11,
377,11,Ive sailed upon the seven seas
378,11,and stopped in every land
379,11,Ive seen the wonders of the world
380,11,not yet one common man
381,11,
382,11,I know ten thousand women
383,11,called Jane and Mary Jane
384,11,but Ive not seen any two
385,11,who really were the same
386,11,
387,11,Mirror twins are different
388,11,although their features jibe
389,11,and lovers think quite different thoughts
390,11,while lying side by side
391,11,
392,11,We love and lose in China
393,11,we weep on Englands moors
394,11,and laugh and moan in Guinea
395,11,and thrive on Spanish shores
396,11,
397,11,We seek success in Finland
398,11,are born and die in Maine
399,11,In minor ways we differ
400,11,in major were the same
401,11,
402,11,I note the obvious differences
403,11,between each sort and type
404,11,but we are more alike my friends
405,11,than we are unalike
406,11,
407,11,We are more alike my friends
408,11,than we are unalike
409,11,
410,11,We are more alike my friends
411,11,than we are unalike
412,12,She came home running
413,12,back to the mothering blackness   
414,12,deep in the smothering blackness
415,12,white tears icicle gold plains of her face   
416,12,She came home running
417,12,
418,12,She came down creeping
419,12,here to the black arms waiting
420,12,now to the warm heart waiting
421,12,rime of alien dreams befrosts her rich brown face   
422,12, She came down creeping
423,12,
424,12,She came home blameless
425,12,black yet as Hagar’s daughter
426,12,tall as was Sheba’s daughter
427,12,threats of northern winds die on the desert’s face   
428,12,She came home blameless
429,13,Curtains forcing their will   
430,13,against the wind
431,13,children sleep
432,13,exchanging dreams with   
433,13,seraphim The city
434,13,drags itself awake on   
435,13,subway straps and
436,13,I an alarm awake as a   
437,13,rumor of war
438,13,lie stretching into dawn   
439,13,unasked and unheeded
440,14,Her arms semaphore fat triangles
441,14,Pudgy hands bunched on layered hips
442,14,Where bones idle under years of fatback
443,14,And lima beans
444,14,Her jowls shiver in accusation
445,14,Of crimes clichéd by
446,14,Repetition Her children strangers
447,14,To childhoods toys play
448,14,Best the games of darkened doorways
449,14,Rooftop tag and know the slick feel of
450,14,Other peoples property
451,14,
452,14,Too fat to whore
453,14,Too mad to work
454,14,Searches her dreams for the
455,14,Lucky sign and walks barehanded
456,14,Into a den of bureaucrats for
457,14,Her portion
458,14,They dont give me welfare
459,14,I take it
460,15,The night has been long
461,15,The wound has been deep
462,15,The pit has been dark
463,15,And the walls have been steep
464,15,
465,15,Under a dead blue sky on a distant beach
466,15,I was dragged by my braids just beyond your reach
467,15,Your hands were tied your mouth was bound
468,15,You couldnt even call out my name
469,15,You were helpless and so was I
470,15,But unfortunately throughout history
471,15,Youve worn a badge of shame
472,15,
473,15,I say the night has been long
474,15,The wound has been deep
475,15,The pit has been dark
476,15,And the walls have been steep
477,15,
478,15,But today voices of old spirit sound
479,15,Speak to us in words profound
480,15,Across the years across the centuries
481,15,Across the oceans and across the seas
482,15,They say draw near to one another
483,15,Save your race
484,15,You have been paid for in a distant place
485,15,The old ones remind us that slaverys chains
486,15,Have paid for our freedom again and again
487,15,
488,15,The night has been long
489,15,The pit has been deep
490,15,The night has been dark
491,15,And the walls have been steep
492,15,
493,15,The hells we have lived through and live through still
494,15,Have sharpened our senses and toughened our will
495,15,The night has been long
496,15,This morning I look through your anguish
497,15,Right down to your soul
498,15,I know that with each other we can make ourselves whole
499,15,I look through the posture and past your disguise
500,15,And see your love for family in your big brown eyes
501,15,
502,15,I say clap hands and lets come together in this meeting ground
503,15,I say clap hands and lets deal with each other with love
504,15,I say clap hands and let us get from the low road of indifference
505,15,Clap hands let us come together and reveal our hearts
506,15,Let us come together and revise our spirits
507,15,Let us come together and cleanse our souls
508,15,Clap hands lets leave the preening
509,15,And stop impostering our own history
510,15,Clap hands call the spirits back from the ledge
511,15,Clap hands let us invite joy into our conversation
512,15,Courtesy into our bedrooms
513,15,Gentleness into our kitchen
514,15,Care into our nursery
515,15,
516,15,The ancestors remind us despite the history of pain
517,15,We are a goingon people who will rise again
518,15,
519,15,And still we rise
520,16,I keep on dying again
521,16,Veins collapse opening like the
522,16,Small fists of sleeping
523,16,Children
524,16,Memory of old tombs
525,16,Rotting flesh and worms do
526,16,Not convince me against
527,16,The challenge The years
528,16,And cold defeat live deep in
529,16,Lines along my face
530,16,They dull my eyes yet
531,16,I keep on dying
532,16,Because I love to live
533,17,The eye follows the land
534,17,Slips upward creases down forms   
535,17,The gentle buttocks of a young   
536,17,Giant In the nestle
537,17,Old adobe bricks washed of   
538,17,Whiteness paled to umber
539,17,Await another century
540,17,
541,17,Star Jasmine and old vines
542,17,Lay claim upon the ghosted land   
543,17,Then quiet pools whisper   
544,17,Private childhood secrets
545,17,
546,17,Flush on inner cottage walls   
547,17,Antiquitous faces
548,17,Used to the gelid breath
549,17,Of old manors glare disdainfully   
550,17,Over breached time
551,17,
552,17,Around and through these   
553,17,Cold phantasmatalities   
554,17,He walks insisting
555,17,To the languid air
556,17,Activity music
557,17,A generosity of graces
558,17,
559,17,His lupin fields spurn old
560,17,Deceit and agile poppies dance
561,17,In golden riot   Each day is
562,17,Fulminant exploding brightly   
563,17,Under the gaze of his exquisite   
564,17,Sires frozen in the famed paint   
565,17,Of dead masters Audacious   
566,17,Sunlight casts defiance
567,17,At their feet
568,18,When I was young I used to
569,18,Watch behind the curtains
570,18,As men walked up and down the street Wino men old men
571,18,Young men sharp as mustard
572,18,See them Men are always
573,18,Going somewhere
574,18,They knew I was there Fifteen
575,18,Years old and starving for them
576,18,Under my window they would pauses
577,18,Their shoulders high like the
578,18,Breasts of a young girl
579,18,Jacket tails slapping over
580,18,Those behinds
581,18,Men
582,18,
583,18,One day they hold you in the
584,18,Palms of their hands gentle as if you
585,18,Were the last raw egg in the world Then
586,18,They tighten up Just a little The
587,18,First squeeze is nice A quick hug
588,18,Soft into your defenselessness A little
589,18,More The hurt begins Wrench out a
590,18,Smile that slides around the fear When the
591,18,Air disappears
592,18,Your mind pops exploding fiercely briefly
593,18,Like the head of a kitchen match Shattered
594,18,It is your juice
595,18,That runs down their legs Staining their shoes
596,18,When the earth rights itself again
597,18,And taste tries to return to the tongue
598,18,Your body has slammed shut Forever
599,18,No keys exist
600,18,
601,18,Then the window draws full upon
602,18,Your mind There just beyond
603,18,The sway of curtains men walk
604,18,Knowing something
605,18,Going someplace
606,18,But this time I will simply
607,18,Stand and watch
608,18,
609,18,Maybe
610,18,
611,19,A Rock A River A Tree
612,19,Hosts to species long since departed   
613,19,Marked the mastodon
614,19,The dinosaur who left dried tokens   
615,19,Of their sojourn here
616,19,On our planet floor
617,19,Any broad alarm of their hastening doom   
618,19,Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages
619,19,
620,19,But today the Rock cries out to us clearly forcefully   
621,19,Come you may stand upon my
622,19,Back and face your distant destiny
623,19,But seek no haven in my shadow
624,19,I will give you no hiding place down here
625,19,
626,19,You created only a little lower than
627,19,The angels have crouched too long in   
628,19,The bruising darkness
629,19,Have lain too long
630,19,Facedown in ignorance
631,19,Your mouths spilling words
632,19,Armed for slaughter
633,19,
634,19,The Rock cries out to us today   
635,19,You may stand upon me   
636,19,But do not hide your face
637,20,A Rock A River A Tree
638,20,Hosts to species long since departed
639,20,Mark the mastodon
640,20,The dinosaur who left dry tokens
641,20,Of their sojourn here
642,20,On our planet floor
643,20,Any broad alarm of their of their hastening doom
644,20,Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages
645,20,But today the Rock cries out to us clearly forcefully
646,20,Come you may stand upon my
647,20,Back and face your distant destiny
648,20,But seek no haven in my shadow
649,20,I will give you no hiding place down here
650,20,You created only a little lower than
651,20,The angels have crouched too long in
652,20,The bruising darkness
653,20,Have lain too long
654,20,Face down in ignorance
655,20,Your mouths spelling words
656,20,Armed for slaughter
657,20,The rock cries out today you may stand on me
658,20,But do not hide your face
659,20,Across the wall of the world
660,20,A river sings a beautiful song
661,20,Come rest here by my side
662,20,Each of you a bordered country
663,20,Delicate and strangely made proud
664,20,Yet thrusting perpetually under siege
665,20,Your armed struggles for profit
666,20,Have left collars of waste upon
667,20,My shore currents of debris upon my breast
668,20,Yet today I call you to my riverside
669,20,If you will study war no more
670,20,Come clad in peace and I will sing the songs
671,20,The Creator gave to me when I
672,20,And the tree and stone were one
673,20,Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your brow
674,20,And when you yet knew you still knew nothing
675,20,The river sings and sings on
676,20,There is a true yearning to respond to
677,20,The singing river and the wise rock
678,20,So say the Asian the Hispanic the Jew
679,20,The African and Native American the Sioux
680,20,The Catholic the Muslim the French the Greek
681,20,The Irish the Rabbi the Priest the Sheikh
682,20,The Gay the Straight the Preacher
683,20,The privileged the homeless the teacher
684,20,They hear They all hear
685,20,The speaking of the tree
686,20,Today the first and last of every tree
687,20,Speaks to humankind Come to me here beside the river
688,20,Plant yourself beside me here beside the river
689,20,Each of you descendant of some passed on
690,20,Traveller has been paid for
691,20,You who gave me my first name
692,20,You Pawnee Apache and Seneca
693,20,You Cherokee Nation who rested with me
694,20,Then forced on bloody feet
695,20,Left me to the employment of other seekers
696,20,Desperate for gain starving for gold
697,20,You the Turk the Swede the German the Scot
698,20,You the Ashanti the Yoruba the Kru
699,20,Bought sold stolen arriving on a nightmare
700,20,Praying for a dream
701,20,Here root yourselves beside me
702,20,I am the tree planted by the river
703,20,Which will not be moved
704,20,I the rock I the river I the tree
705,20,I am yoursyour passages have been paid
706,20,Lift up your faces you have a piercing need
707,20,For this bright morning dawning for you
708,20,History despite its wrenching pain
709,20,Cannot be unlived and if faced with courage
710,20,Need not be lived again
711,20,Lift up your eyes upon
712,20,The day breaking for you
713,20,Give birth again
714,20,To the dream
715,20,Women children men
716,20,Take it into the palms of your hands
717,20,Mold it into the shape of your most
718,20,Private need Sculpt it into
719,20,The image of your most public self
720,20,Lift up your hearts
721,20,Each new hour holds new chances
722,20,For new beginnings
723,20,Do not be wedded forever
724,20,To fear yoked eternally
725,20,To brutishness
726,20,The horizon leans forward
727,20,Offering you space to place new steps of change
728,20,Here on the pulse of this fine day
729,20,You may have the courage
730,20,To look up and out upon me
731,20,The rock the river the tree your country
732,20,No less to Midas than the mendicant
733,20,No less to you now than the mastodon then
734,20,Here on the pulse of this new day
735,20,You may have the grace to look up and out
736,20,And into your sisters eyes
737,20,Into your brothers face your country
738,20,And say simply
739,20,Very simply
740,20,With hope
741,20,Good morning
742,21,There are some nights when
743,21,sleep plays coy
744,21,aloof and disdainful
745,21,And all the wiles
746,21,that I employ to win
747,21,its service to my side
748,21,are useless as wounded pride
749,21,and much more painful
750,22,We were entwined in red rings   
751,22,Of blood and loneliness before   
752,22,The first snows fell
753,22,Before muddy rivers seeded clouds   
754,22,Above a virgin forest and   
755,22,Men ran naked blue and black   
756,22,Skinned into the warm embraces   
757,22,Of Sheba Eve and Lilith
758,22,I was your sister
759,22,
760,22,You left me to force strangers  
761,22,Into brother molds exacting   
762,22,Taxations they never
763,22,Owed or could ever pay
764,22,
765,22,You fought to die thinking   
766,22,In destruction lies the seed   
767,22,Of birth You may be right
768,22,
769,22,I will remember silent walks in   
770,22,Southern woods and long talks   
771,22,In low voices
772,22,Shielding meaning from the big ears   
773,22,Of overcurious adults
774,22,
775,22,You may be right   
776,22,Your slow return from
777,22,Regions of terror and bloody
778,22,Screams races my heart
779,22,I hear again the laughter   
780,22,Of children and see fireflies   
781,22,Bursting tiny explosions in   
782,22,An Arkansas twilight
